                    Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) while counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the release of the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification ("mod") for Half-Life that was designed by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe before the rights to the mod's intellectual property were acquired by Valve, the developers of Half-Life, who then turned Counter-Strike into a retail product.

                    Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near-future.[1][2][3][4] Players assume the control of agents, characters who come from a plethora of countries and cultures around the world.[4] In the main game mode, players join either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities and use an economic system to purchase their abilities and weapons. The game has an assortment of weapons including sidearms, submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.[5][6] Automatic weapons such as the "Spectre" and "Odin" have recoil patterns which have to be controlled by the player in order to be able to shoot accurately.[6]
